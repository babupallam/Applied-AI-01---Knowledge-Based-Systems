## Overview of Knowledge-Based Systems
Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) are a branch of artificial intelligence that use knowledge about a specific domain to solve complex problems. These systems typically rely on knowledge representation, inference mechanisms, and reasoning to make decisions or provide solutions.

KBS are used in various fields including medicine, engineering, finance, and more. They can range from simple rule-based systems to complex expert systems and hybrid models that integrate machine learning.
